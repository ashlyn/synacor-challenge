# Beach

## west
east, north (west too steep)
north: north, south, east

  keep north to cave then
  north, south, east
  east: journal
keep north: take orb, 22 on pedestal
north: +, north 4, north *
rooms are a grid

| col 1 | col2 | col3 | col4 |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| * | 8 | - | 30/1 |
| 4 | * | 11 | * |
| + | 4 | - | 18 |
| 22 | - | 9 | * |

30/1 room has a 30 on the door with an hourglass
1 on floor also the vault (sealed)

I'm guessing you need to go in the right order to arrive at 30 (with the last room/vault room counting as 1)

## east
seem to be the same

## north
seem to be the same

`uvduAAXTIUbq` incorrect, maybe due to reg 8 not being set correctly?
maybe it's "mirrored"
